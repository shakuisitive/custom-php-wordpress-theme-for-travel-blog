<h3 id="scrap-the-stinger"><strong>Scrap the stinger</strong></h3>
A bee leaves a stinger at the sting site, which is usually venomous so it is crucial to remove that to be safe from any complications.

Removing the stinger from the finger is not a complicated task, start by:

Identifying the stinger by having a close look at the sting site.

Use the nails of your other finger and slowly scrap it.

Optionally, you can use something that has a straight edge, like an ATM card.

You should also avoid using things like tweezers which will squeeze and release venom from the stinger.
<h3 id="wash-the-sting-site"><strong>Wash the sting site</strong></h3>
A bee sting has venom in it so it is essential to wash the sting site after removing the stinger.

Clean your stung finger with soap and water.
<h3 id="baking-soda"><strong>Baking soda</strong></h3>
It is natural and beneficial against pain and itching on a finger after a bee sting.

Mix a teaspoon of baking soda with water. You only need to prepare a thick paste and apply it to the finger.

Make sure not to add too much water which may affect the thickness of the pate.
<h3 id="apply-ice"><strong>Apply ice</strong></h3>
Applying ice on a finger can help with swelling after a bee sting.

Do not apply it directly though; cover an ice cube with plastic and use it to the sting site.

With a gap of a few seconds, apply ice for 10 – minutes.
<h3 id="apply-calamine-lotion"><strong>Apply calamine lotion</strong></h3>
You can apply calamine lotion to the stung finger if you experience itching, irritation, or pain after a bee sting. This can also be pretty helpful if the discomfort carries on even after removing the stinger.

However, if your finger feels fine after removing the stinger, you can skip this step.
<h3 id="exercise-fingers"><strong>Exercise fingers</strong></h3>
Gently moving your finger can improve blood circulation, which should help in reducing swelling after a bee sting.

Slowly raise and lower your stung finger, then move it side to side.

These simple, gentle exercises are safe for the sting site and can help reduce swelling effectively.
<h3 id="dont-put-a-burden-fingers"><strong>Don't put a burden fingers</strong></h3>
Give your stung finger enough rest and avoid lifting heavy objects, as this can increase swelling at the sting site.

Be careful doing activities that have the potential to cause discomfort, like typing or using a smartphone.

Generally, resting the finger for 12 to 24 hours is sufficient for recovery after a bee sting.
<h3 id="avoid-gloves"><strong>Avoid gloves</strong></h3>
Do not wear gloves; the sting site must remain open for a few hours after a bee sting.

Let it be free from any coverage, be it from a glove or a similar item.
<h3 id="remove-ring"><strong>Remove ring</strong></h3>
If you're someone who puts on a ring, you should take it off as wearing a ring on the stung finger can worsen the condition by causing intense swelling.

The stung site needs proper blood circulation to heal quickly and putting on a ring or any other jewelry doesn't help with that.
<h3 id="eat-indoor"><strong>Eat indoor</strong></h3>
Having outdoor meals is one reason to get a bee sting on the finger. As mentioned in the introduction, bees are fond of sweet and sugary foods, so if you have just taken any of these from your finger, you have a high chance of attracting them.

Remember, using only a napkin or tissue isn’t enough and you should thoroughly wash your hands after meals to avoid attracting bees to any remaining traces of food on your fingers.
<h2><strong>How long does a bee sting on a finger swelling last?</strong></h2>
The duration of swelling on a finger can vary by different conditions. i.e., if your finger is stung by a dangerous bee like the honey bee, or you haven't taken quick care of the sting site, the swelling will last longer, from a minimum of 48 hours to even a week.

However, if a sting is from a less harmful bee, such as a sweat bee, and you also took proper aftercare of the sting site, it will take around a few hours to a few days maximum for things to get back to normal.
<h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2>
Bees are independently flying species usually found in the outdoors. And if you were having a meal on your lawn that could be one of the reasons you got a sting on your finger.

Besides that, there could be many other reasons to get a sting on the finger.

Simply put, there's nothing to worry about if you have a finger sting!

What matters the most is the actions you take after getting that sting so practice what's right and then hopefully nothing to panic as a bee sting on your finger is curable and is not a serious concern.
